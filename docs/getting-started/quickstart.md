The ERC-7621 stands out as a groundbreaking token standard specifically designed to streamline the creation of investment funds on the blockchain.

In essence, ERC-7621 is positioned to emerge as the predominant standard for on-chain fund management. This versatile standard accommodates a wide spectrum of assets, including but not limited to REITs, FX, synthetics, derivatives, cryptocurrencies, and any other tokenized assets. The ERC-7621 is poised to revolutionize fund management, offering unprecedented flexibility and efficiency in handling a myriad of tokenized assets within a single framework.
