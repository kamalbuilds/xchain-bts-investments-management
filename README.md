Alvara's protocol is intricately designed to enhance the functionality of the innovative ERC-BTS token standard, developed by Alvara's expert team. 
The ERC-BTS stands out as a groundbreaking token standard specifically designed to streamline the creation of investment funds on the blockchain. 
This standard enables an ERC-BTS token to encompass a diverse array of underlying assets, granted they are tokenized and accessible either on a supported EVM blockchain or through integration with Wormhole.

In essence, ERC-BTS is positioned to emerge as the predominant standard for on-chain fund management. 
This versatile standard accommodates a wide spectrum of assets, including but not limited to REITs, FX, synthetics, derivatives, cryptocurrencies, and any other tokenized assets.
The ERC-BTS is poised to revolutionize fund management, offering unprecedented flexibility and efficiency in handling a myriad of tokenized assets within a single framework.
